## Backlog

- git ref log

- docker image diff arch via docker template
- Encrypter perm records
- JWT refresh token - since not included in 
- architecture x64 amd64 arm etc.
- gRPC for microservice communication

## Feedback
Advanced Git:
Fair understanding of squash and stash
Room for improvement in commands like "reflog"

Docker
Fair understanding of Dockerfile commands like FROM, WORKDIR, COPY, RUN
Slight Room for improvement in ENTRYPOINT and CMD, but overally sound in this
Room for improvement in Building and releasing images to Container Registry, needs more understanding on manifest and build context

Permissions & Storing encrypted records
Fair understanding on basic idea of how to do it
Room for improvement in actually implementing these permissions

PyTest - Unit Testing
Good understanding on basics and implementations
No room for improvement as a SSE

Middlewares
Fair understanding of middlewares and how it works
Room for improvement in modifying and using middlewares in details

Microservices, Not experienced, needs well defined courses to learn & practice

JWT
Good understanding on basic concepts and hand-ons
Room for improvement in advanced topics such as refreshing tokens and custom logics

Django ORM (Couldn't find lot of time to cover this, but overall has sound understanding)
